                Applications written in Python are executed by the Python interpreter. The Python
                interpreter is a program that reads Python code and executes it. The Python
                interpreter is available for all major operating systems: Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python interpreter reads
                and executes the code line by line. This is different from compiled languages like
                C++ or Java, where the code is compiled into an executable file before it is run.
            </p>
            <!-- before installing python, check to see if it's already installed. -->
            <p>
                Before installing Python, check to see if it is already installed on your computer.
                Open a command prompt or terminal window and type <code>python --version</code> or
                <code>python3 --version</code>. If Python is installed, you will see the version
                number. If Python is not installed, you will see an error message.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                Note: if you are using Windows, you may be asked to install Python from the
                Microsoft
                Store. This is not recommended. Instead, download Python from the official Python
                website.

                To install Python, follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Open a web browser and go to the <a
                            href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python download page</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Python download page will automatically detect your operating system and
                        display the appropriate download link for the your system. There are also links
                        to download the latest version of Python for other operating systems.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click on the <strong>Download Python</strong> button to download the latest
                    version of Python for your computer. This installation download should not take
                    long.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Python on
                    your computer. Be sure to check the box that says <strong>Add Python to
                        PATH</strong>.
                    The option to run as administrator is optional, but not necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the installation completes, again this should not take long. You have an option
                    to disable the path length limit. This is optional. If you are using very long
                    pathnames,
                    it may be useful, but this can usually be managed by organizing your files and
                    folders
                    so it is generally not necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can close the installer.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment</h3>
        <div id="launch-idle">
            <p>
                Python comes with an Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE) that
                provides a graphical user interface for writing and running Python code. IDLE is
                included with the Python installation and is available on all major operating systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                To run IDLE, follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                From Windows:
                <li>
                    <p>Open the Start menu and type <strong>idle</strong> in the search box.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Click on the <strong>IDLE (Python 3.x.x)</strong> icon to launch IDLE.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Once IDLE is open, you can start writing and running Python code in the IDLE
                        editor window.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                From MacOS:
                <li>
                    <p>Open the Applications folder and double-click on the <strong>IDLE</strong> icon
                        to launch IDLE.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Once IDLE is open, you can start writing and running Python code in the IDLE
                        editor window.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                That's it! You are now ready to start writing and running Python code in IDLE.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Using the Menu items, create a new file and save it as <code>hello.py</code>.</li>
                <li>Write the following code in the editor window:
                    <pre><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>Run the code by selecting <strong>Run &rarr; Run Module</strong> from the menu.</li>
                <li>The output <code>Hello, World!</code> should appear in the IDLE shell window.</li>
            </ol>
