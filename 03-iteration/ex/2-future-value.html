            <h3>Investment Growth</h3>
            <p>
                Create a Python application that will allow the user to calculate the future value 
                of an investment. The user will enter a monthly amount, annual interest rate and 
                number of years for the investment.</p>
            <p>You will code a loop to calculate the future value and display the value of each 
                month and then display the final value.</p>
            <p>Some key formulas and free Python code snippets:</p>
            <p>Note that the term is in years but we need to show the value of each month. So a 5 
                year savings account would be 60 months.</p>
            <p><code>months = years * 12</code></p>
            <p>Interest rates are a percentage and entered as 3.25 (i.e., for 3.25%), 1.125, etc. 
                This is also an annual percentage rate (APR). We need to divide this rate by 100 
                and then by 12 to get the monthly percentage rate.</p>
            <p><code>monthlyIntRate = annualIntRate / 100 /12</code></p>
            <p>The futureValue variable is an accumulator as it accumulates value as the loop executes.</p>
            <p><code>futureValue = (futureValue + monthlyAmount) * (1 + monthlyRate)</code></p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a new file called <code>Lab4FutureValue.py</code> in your <code>\Labs\Lab04</code> 
                    folder.</li>
                <li>Code the application. Some of the code is given. The parts that are blurred 
                    out you get to code!<br />
                    <img 
                        src="/py/images/investment-code.png" 
                        alt="investment sample code" />
                    <p>At about line 17, there is a line that assigns a string <code>msg</code> to:<br />
                        <code>"month: {0:3d} FV: ${1:.2f} Interest ${2:.2f}"</code><br />
                        note those are <em>curly braces</em> "{}", not parentheses "()"</p>
                    <p>Specifically this string as used for the <code>.format()</code> command used below.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Test your application using the following values:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monthly Amount = 100</li>
                        <li>Interest Rate = 6</li>
                        <li>Years = 5</li>
                    </ul>
                    Your result should be somewhere around $7011.88. Results should be reasonably 
                    close (+/- 2%). Don&rsquo;t worry if your results have a large number of decimal 
                    places. Number formatting is optional for this exercise.
                </li>
                <li>Calculate and display the total interest earned. After the loop, add a line to display 
                    the total interest earned.</li>
            </ol>
