            <h3>Making Decisions in Code</h3>
            <p>
                This lab provides an opportunity to apply the concepts and principles presented 
                in the module and the text.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    Topics:
                    <li>Creating a Python console application</li>
                    <li>Declaring variables</li>
                    <li>Assigning values to variables</li>
                    <li>Arithmetic operations</li>
                    <li>Python repetition (loop) structures</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                This time, in addition to writing Python source code, you will also create two (2) 
                flowcharts as they are commonly used as design documents to communicate programming 
                structure, and they are a good graphical representation of looping structures.
            </p>
            <p>
