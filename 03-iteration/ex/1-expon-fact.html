            <h3>A Guided Python Application: Exponents and Factorials</h3>
            <div id="ex1-intro">
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>
                    Loops or repetition structures are used extensively in software development 
                    so it's very important to get comfortable coding these. The exercise 
                    we're going to do here isn't necessarily real practical but it 
                    does illustrate the use of loops for a couple of common arithmetic operations. 
                    The first one we'll do is an exponent function. Most modern programming 
                    languages have either an exponent operator (I.e., Visual Basic, Python) or a 
                    built-in library function (Java, C#) to calculate exponents so, once again, 
                    we're doing this just to get some hands-on practice coding loops. The other 
                    arithmetic operation we'll do is the factorial function.
                </p>
                <h4>Design</h4>
                <p>
                    This time around, let's make flowcharts. A flowchart is a graphical means of 
                    representing an algorithm or process, making it easier to understand and 
                    communicate.
                </p>
                <p class="boxed-paragraph">
                    This flowchart is a simplified version of the <strong>Activity Diagram.</strong><br />
                    Flowcharts are still widely used in industry as design documents to communicate 
                    program structure.

                <p style="font-style: italic;">
                    Read the instructions carefully. You will practice with two different functions 
                    in this first Exercise (1).

                <h3>Creating Flowcharts</h3>
                <p>First, review the basic flowchart shapes.</p>
                <p>
                    <img 
                    src="/py/images/flowchart_shapes.png"

                    width="90%" /></p>
                <p>fig.1 Flowchart Shapes</p>
                <p>
                    For doing exponents, we know from past math classes the expression 2<sup>4</sup>
                    is really a shorthand notation for the expression 2*2*2*2. This looks like something 
                    we could do with a loop, right? Let's give it a shot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll use the online tool <a href="http://draw.io">Draw.io</a>. It is a drawing 
                    tool similar to Microsoft Visio.
                </p>
                <p>Start out by creating a new diagram.</p>
                <p><img src="/py/images/new-diagram.png" 
                    alt="new diagram dialog in Draw.io" 
                    width="90%" /></p>
                <p>fig.2 New Diagram</p>
                <p>Select (1) Blank Diagram and then (2) Create.</p>
                <p><img src="/py/images/create_blank.png" 
                    alt="select create blank diagram dialog" 
                    width="90%" /></p>
                <p>fig.3 Create from Blank</p>
                <p>You can also select Flowcharts and then Create.</p>
                <p><img src="/py/images/create_flowchart.png" 
                    alt="create from flowchart template" 
                    width="90%" /></p>
                <p>fig.4 or Create from Flowcharts</p>
                <p class="boxed-paragraph">
                    Which shapes you choose matter. Hover over each shape in the palette to find its 
                    correct purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will get a blank drawing with various tool palettes of shapes on the left side. 
                    Expand Flowchart. The “key” shapes we'll be using are highlighted below. Select a 
                    shape, hold down the left mouse button, and then drag and then drop the shape onto 
                    the page. Double-click the shape to add text. A “proper” flowchart will have a 
                    distinct start and end; all shapes will have appropriate labels, and all structures 
                    will have a single entry and exit point.
                </p>
                <p><img src="/py/images/flow_shapes.png" 
                    alt="common flowchart shapes" 
                    width="90%" /></p>
                <p>fig.5 Common flowchart shapes for this exercise</p>
                <p>
                    First, drag and drop a Start/End oval (or “lozenge” as the textbook likes to call it) 
                    onto the page. Double-click the oval and label it as either “Start” or “Begin”. Drag 
                    and drop a Data (Input/Output) parallelogram onto the page. If you hover over the 
                    parallelogram in the Flowchart shapes palette, you will see it is used to indicate 
                    "Data".
                </p>
                <p>
                    To save time and space, we'll combine our inputs into one shape. Double-click the 
                    parallelogram and enter the required inputs. In this case, we need the number and the 
                    power or exponent. Your flowchart should look something like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img 
                        src="/py/images/get-inputs.png" 
                        alt="get inputs" /></p>
                <p>fig.6 Get inputs</p>
                <p>
                    Click on the Start oval and drag the flow line/arrow to the parallelogram. You can 
                    also use the Connector tool in the tool bar to draw flow lines. Be aware getting 
                    flowlines drawn correctly can be a bit of a trial and error process. The flowchart 
                    should now look something like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img 
                        src="/py/images/adding-flowlines.png" 
                        alt="adding flow-lines" /></p>
                <p>
                    <img 
                        src="/py/images/added-flowlines.png" 
                        alt="added flow-lines" /></p>
                <p>fig.7&amp;8 Add flow-lines</p>
                <p>Note how the arrow on the connector always points to the next step.</p>
                <p>
                    Next, drag and drop a process box (rectangle) onto the page, double-click and 
                    initialize the loop counter with the statement i = 0. Also, we need a variable f
                    or the result that will be initialized to 1 so add the statement result = 1. 
                    When coding loops, it's generally accepted and understood the single letter 
                    variables i, j and k are loop counters. If you prefer to use a variable name 
                    such as count, that's fine too. Draw a line from the input to the process box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, add a decision diamond to test the loop condition. Since we initialized 
                    i = 0, we need to ask the question is i &lt; exponent. Draw a flow line into 
                    the top of the decision diamond. The flowchart will now look like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img 
                        src="/py/images/decision.png" 
                        alt="adding the decision block" />
                </p>
                <p>fig.9 Start &gt; Input &gt; Initialize &gt; Conditional</p>
                <p>
                    In a decision diamond, there will always be 2 flow lines coming out; one for 
                    the true path and 1 for the false path. For a loop, when the loop condition 
                    is false, the loop will terminate. We’ll arbitrarily start with the true path 
                    so we need to add a process box to set result = result * number and, very 
                    important, increment the loop counter by 1. Again, to save time and space, 
                    we'll put both in the same box. Draw a flow line from the right side of the 
                    decision diamond to the process box. Double-click the flow line and label true. 
                    It's also generally accepted to use Yes/No, T/F or Y/N Instead of True/False. 
                    Add a flow line from the process box to the top of the decision diamond. Our 
                    flowchart should now look something like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img 
                        src="/py/images/loop.png"
                         alt="flowchart showing loop structure" /></p>
                <p>fig.10 Loop structure</p>
                <p>
                    When the loop condition is false, the loop will terminate and the next step will
                    be to add another data (input/output) parallelogram to display the result. Add 
                    a flowline labeled false from the bottom of the decision diamond to our output 
                    step. Last, add a terminator and a flowline from the output. Our finished 
                    flowchart will look like this:</p>
                <p>
                    <img 
                        src="/py/images/flow-exponent.png" 
                        alt="example flowchart for exponent" />
                </p>
                <p>fig.11 Exponent - Flowchart</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>Things to notice about a <em>properly drawn</em> flowchart:
                    <li>Distinct start/end points.</li>
                    <li>Flowlines run from top to bottom, left to right with the exception 
                        of flow lines going to the top of a loop.</li>
                    <li>Flowlines in a decision are clearly labeled with the true and false 
                        path.</li>
                    <li>Arrows on flow lines point to the next step in the process.</li>
                    <li>Each program structure has exactly one entry and one exit point; no 
                        steps lead to a dead end.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    Last thing: Be sure to save your work! If you plan to edit or do work on your 
                    flowchart later on, be sure to click on File and then <em>Save as</em></p>

                <h3>Factorial</h3>
                <p class="boxed-paragraph">
                    For the factorial exercise, recall from an earlier math class that the expression 
                    <code>5!</code> is simply a short hand notation for <code>1*2*3*4*5</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once again, does this look like something we could code using a loop?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refer to the previous exercise if you need details on how to create a flowchart, 
                    add shapes, draw flow lines, etc. The factorial flowchart should look something 
                    like this:

                <p>
                    For both exercises, notice how we initialized our result variable to 1 because 
                    multiplying by 0 will give a result of 0. Be aware! Little things like this are 
                    very common logical errors in programming!
