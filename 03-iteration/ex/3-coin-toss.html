            <h3>Heads or Tails!</h3>
            <p>In this exercise, you will get some experience with the random number generator 
                in Python. Random numbers are heavily used in many games and simulations for 
                things like dice rolls, dealing cards, flipping a coin, etc.</p>
            <p>You will build an application that will flip a coin 20 times, keep a running 
                total of heads and tails.</p>
            <p>For each coin toss, display the result (heads or tails).</p>
            <p>After the last toss, you will display</p>
            <ul>
                <li>total number of heads</li>
                <li>total number of tails</li>
                <li>and the percentage of each</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a new Python file called <code>HeadsTails.py</code></li>
                <li>Code the application. Be sure to import random. A screen shot of a partially 
                    coded application is given here to get you started:<br />
                    The header was incorrect also so that is blurred out for you to replace too.<br />

                <li>Test your application.</li>
