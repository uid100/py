          It is important to test your code with a variety of test data as you develop your solution.
          This helps to ensure that your code works correctly for all possible input values and scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by creating a table that outlines the test data you plan to use, including a range of expected
          input values and calculate the expected output for each case. It is important to calculate the 
          expected output manually or using a reliable method to ensure accuracy before running your code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often you cannot anticipate all possible input values, so be sure to include edge cases and invalid 
          inputs in your test data. This will help you identify any potential issues or bugs in your code.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have your test data ready, run your code with each input value and compare the actual output 
          to the expected output.
          If the outputs match, your code is working correctly for that test case. If they do not match, you will 
          need to debug your code to identify and fix the issue.

          Test data, including identified inputs and expected outputs is not the same thing as actual test results!
