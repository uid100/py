            <h2>Submission</h2>
            <p>When you have completed the lab exercises, you will submit your work to Canvas.
            </p>
            <p>
                As before, include all your python source files and the requested test data text (.txt) files.
                Zip your lab folder and submit the <code>Lab02.zip</code> file to Canvas.
            </p>
            <h3>Reminders</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Be sure to test all your code and make sure your calculations are correct.</li>
                <li>Make sure your code meets the requirements specified in each exercise.</li>
                <li>All your identifiers, including filenames, variables, and constants, should
                have clear, meaningful, and descriptive names.
                    <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                        <li>"exercise1" does not describe the file or its contents.</li>
                        <li>"value1" could mean anything!</li>
                        <li>"height_in_inches" clearly describes a variable representing a height 
                            measured in inches. Anyone reading the code would understand its purpose.
                        </li>
                        <li>"MONTHS_PER_YEAR" clearly describes a constant representing the number of 
                            months in a year. Anywhere in the code, anyone would understand its purpose.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do not forget the required comments at the beginning of each source code file, including:
                    <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                        <li>Your name</li>
                        <li>Course name and number</li>
                        <li>Lab number and exercise number</li>
                        <li>Brief description of the program</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Include a table of test data and expected results for each exercise.</li>
