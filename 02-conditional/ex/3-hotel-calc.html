            <h3>Coyote Inn</h3>
            <p>Coyote Inn has hired you to develop a new application to estimate charges for staying at their new inn. Their nightly rates are based on months of the year and provided in the following table:</p>
            <table class="table table-striped">
                <caption>Coyote Inn nightly rates by month</caption>
                <thead>

            <p>To keep things simple, you can allow the month to be entered by the month number. Normally, this would be done by a date period but we&rsquo;ll do it by month to keep the exercise simple.</p>
            <p>The user must be able to enter a month number (1 &ndash; 12) and the number of nights. Use a decision structure to find the correct price per night for the month entered and then multiply it by the number of nights entered.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Be sure to test all ranges and make sure your calculations are correct.</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Be sure to include a table of test data and expected results.</p>
            <p>Your test data may be in a separate text file or included in the comments in the header of your code.</p>
