            <h3>A Guided Python Application &ndash; Portrait Studio</h3>
            <div id="ex1-intro">
                <p>In this exercise, a portrait studio has hired you to implement a charge calculator for taking portraits. Part of the charge is based on the number of subjects in the portrait.</p>
                <p>This lab is based on an exercise from <strong>An Object-oriented Approach to Programming Logic and Design</strong> by Joyce Farrell &copy;2013</p>

                <h3>Analyzing the Problem</h3>
                <p>From the discussion, we know we can break this problem down into input, process and output.</p>
                <p>What inputs do we need? Let&rsquo;s look at the problem and see if we can identify them:</p>
                <p><img src="https://sdccd.instructure.com/courses/2497070/files/155136928/preview" alt="analyze the problem" width="562" height="132" data-api-endpoint="https://sdccd.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2497070/files/155136928" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
                <p>Now that we&rsquo;ve identified the inputs of last name, number of subjects and the scheduled day of the week, our pseudocode will look something like this:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Get last_name<br />Get num_subjects<br />Get day_of_week<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>Next, let&rsquo;s break down the processing.</p>
                <p>In this exercise, last name really isn&rsquo;t used for anything. In a <em>real world</em> application, data such as last name, address, billing information, etc. would be entered and stored in either a file or database and used for billing, delivering the portraits, etc.</p>
                <p>We&rsquo;ve been given a fee schedule based on the number of subjects for calculating the base price.</p>
                <p>Portraits sittings on Saturday or Sunday are 20% extra.</p>
                <p>These are the 2 processing steps we need but is this clear enough that we could write code? Probably not. So, let&rsquo;s break these steps down a little further. Keep in mind there are a number of ways this problem could be solved. What&rsquo;s presented here is simply one of a number of possible ways so don&rsquo;t take this as the only solution or the way you have to do it. If you have a different approach you want to take, go for it!</p>
                <p>To calculate the base price using the table above, we need to code a decision structure. In the chapter, we saw that we can use an if/else (dual alternative) decision structure. Since we have a number of choices, we&rsquo;ll need to do an expanded, if/else structure. Our pseudocode will look something like this:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />if num_subjects = 1 then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 100<br />else if num_subjects = 2 then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 130<br />else if num_subjects = 3 then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 150<br />else if num_subjects = 4 then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 165<br />else if num_subjects = 5 then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 175<br />else if num_subjects = 6 then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 180<br />else // default catch all 7 or more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 185<br />end if<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>Decision structures like this are heavily used in real world programming so it&rsquo;s beneficial to get experience working with these.</p>
                <p>The next thing is to determine if an additional 20% charge applies. This gets charged if the sitting is on Saturday or Sunday. Once again, there are multiple, possible ways to approach this. We could use an if/else if/else decision structure or we could use a single alternative structure and use the logical OR operator. Here&rsquo;s the pseudocode for both approaches. Both will work and there are other ways that would work too. The choice of which one to use here is really a matter of personal preference.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />#(Dual alternative:)<br />if day_of_week = 7 then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * 1.2<br />else if day_of_week = 1 then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * 1.2<br />else<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// do nothing &ndash; no additional charge<br />end if<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />#(Single alternative:)<br />if day_of_week = 7 OR day_of_week = 1 then &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * 1.2 end if<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>To help guide your final decision, which of these two structures looks easier to code later on?</p>
                <p>Notice in both cases we simply accumulate or add to (well, multiply in this case) the base charge if the condition is true.</p>
                <p>Another point here is the value 1.2 for the surcharge is often called a magic number; its meaning and purpose is unclear. This makes for code that is more difficult to read and understand. To make things more readable and maintainable, let&rsquo;s add a constant called SURCHARGE_PCT and assign it the value 1.2. In languages like Python, Java, C++ and C#, it is customary to declare constants in all upper case letters and use the underscore (_) to space multiple words. The idea is to make them really stick out and not be mistaken for variables. Since Python doesn&rsquo;t have constants and it turns out these are really variables, be careful not to change the values of your Python &ldquo;constants&rdquo; after you declare them.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />SURCHARGE_PCT = 1.2<br /><br />#(Revised Single alternative using constants:)<br />if day_of_week = 7 OR day_of_week = 1 then &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * SURCHARGE_PCT end if<br />&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>Last thing is output.</p>
                <p>Notice that our total price is actually stored in the variable base_price so the pseudocode is very simply the line:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />Display base_price</p>

                <h4>Designing the Solution</h4>
                <p>Create a file called PortraitStudio in IDLE. Be sure to create this on your USB drive if you are using the lab computers. Create a blank text file for your pseudocode and name it pseudocode.txt.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="pseudocode">
                <p>Here&rsquo;s all the pseudocode we saw earlier all in one place. Keep in mind this sample pseudocode is a suggested approach that will work. You are welcome and encouraged to develop your own approach and style.</p>

                <p>Another thing we are going to do in this lab is generate some test data we can use when we test to ensure our application is working correctly and producing correct results.</p>
                <p>We need test data for a varying number of subjects (test the selection structure) and we also need to test the weekend surcharge feature. Having a good table of test input data and the expected results allows us to test our application and be able to tell at a glance if it is working correctly.</p>
                <p>To keep things simple, we will add it to our pseudocode. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be anything fancy but should have enough values that we can test all possible scenarios.</p>
