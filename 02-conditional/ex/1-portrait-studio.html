            <h3>A Guided Python Application &ndash; Portrait Studio</h3>
            <div id="ex1-intro">
                <p>
                    In this exercise, a portrait studio has hired you to implement a charge calculator 
                    for taking portraits. Part of the charge is based on the number of subjects in the 
                    portrait.</p>
                <p>This lab is based on an exercise from <strong>An Object-oriented Approach to Programming 
                    Logic and Design</strong> by Joyce Farrell &copy;2013</p>

                <h3>Analyzing the Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Remember that all software programs break down into input, process and output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What inputs do we need? Look at the problem and try to identify them:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img 
                        src="https://uid100.github.io/py/images/ch3ex9obj.png" 
                        alt="instructions with highlighted inputs and objectives" 
                        width="562" height="132" /></p>
                <p>
                    Now that we've identified the inputs of last name, number of subjects and the scheduled 
                    day of the week, we could write pseudocode something like this:
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    Get last_name<br />
                    Get num_subjects<br />
                    Get day_of_week<br />
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those are the inputs. Next, break down the processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this exercise, last name really is not used for anything. In a <em>real world</em> 
                    application, data such as last name, address, billing information, etc. would be entered 
                    and stored in either a file or database and used for billing, delivering the portraits, 
                    etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have been given a fee schedule based on the number of subjects for calculating the 
                    base price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Portraits sittings on Saturday or Sunday are 20% extra.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are the 2 processing steps we need but is this clear enough that we could write 
                    code? Maybe not. So, break these steps down a little further. Keep in mind there are a 
                    number of ways this problem could be solved. What iss presented here is simply one of 
                    a number of possible ways so don&rsquo;t take this as the only solution or the way you 
                    have to do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To calculate the base price using the table above, we need to code a decision structure. 
                    In the chapter, we saw that we can use an if/else (dual alternative) decision structure. 
                    Since we have a number of choices, we&rsquo;ll need to do an expanded, if/else structure.
                    Our pseudocode will look something like this:
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />
                    if num_subjects = 1 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 100<br />
                    else if num_subjects = 2 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 130<br />
                    else if num_subjects = 3 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 150<br />
                    else if num_subjects = 4 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 165<br />
                    else if num_subjects = 5 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 175<br />
                    else if num_subjects = 6 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 180<br />
                    else // default catch all 7 or more<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = 185<br />
                    end if<br />
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Decision structures like this are heavily used in real world programming so it is 
                    beneficial to get experience working with these.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next thing is to determine if an additional 20% charge applies. This gets charged if 
                    the sitting is on Saturday or Sunday. Once again, there are multiple, possible ways to 
                    approach this. We could use an if/else if/else decision structure or we could use a single 
                    alternative structure and use the logical OR operator. Here&rsquo;s the pseudocode for 
                    both approaches. Both will work and there are other ways that would work too. The choice 
                    of which one to use here is really a matter of personal preference.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />
                    #(Dual alternative:)<br />
                    if day_of_week = 7 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * 1.2<br />
                    else if day_of_week = 1 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * 1.2<br />
                    else<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// do nothing &ndash; no additional charge<br />
                    end if<br />
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />#(Single alternative:)<br />
                    if day_of_week = 7 OR day_of_week = 1 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * 1.2 end if<br />
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
                <p>
                    To help guide your final decision, which of these two structures looks easier to code 
                    later on?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice in both cases we simply accumulate or add to (well, multiply in this case) the 
                    base charge if the condition is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another point here is the value 1.2 for the surcharge is often called a magic number; 
                    its meaning and purpose is unclear. This makes for code that is more difficult to read 
                    and understand. To make things more readable and maintainable, let&rsquo;s add a constant 
                    called SURCHARGE_PCT and assign it the value 1.2.
                </p>
                <p class="boxed-paragraph">
                    In languages like Python, Java, C++ and C#, it is customary to declare 
                    <strong>constants</strong> in all upper case letters and use the underscore 
                    (_) to space multiple words to make them stand out and not be mistaken for 
                    variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Python does not have constants and it turns out these are really variables, be 
                    careful not to change the values of your Python <em>constants</em> after you declare 
                    them.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />
                    SURCHARGE_PCT = 1.2<br />
                    <br />
                    #(Revised Single alternative using constants:)<br />
                    if day_of_week = 7 OR day_of_week = 1 then<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base_price = base_price * SURCHARGE_PCT end if<br />
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last thing is output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice that total price is actually stored in the variable base_price so the 
                    pseudocode is very simply:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
                    &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />
                    Display base_price
                </p>

                <h4>Designing the Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    Create a file called <code>PortraitStudio.py</code> in IDLE. If you are using the 
                    lab computers, be sure to create this on your USB drive.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="test-data">
                <p>
                    For this lab, you will also generate some test data to use when you test to ensure 
                    the application is working correctly and producing expected results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need test data for a varying number of subjects (test the selection structure) 
                    and we also need to test the weekend surcharge feature. Having a good table of test 
                    input data and the expected results allows us to test our application and be able 
                    to tell at a glance if it is working correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Save this test data in a text file. It doesn't need to be anything fancy but should 
                    have enough values that we can test all likely scenarios.
