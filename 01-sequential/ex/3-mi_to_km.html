        Exercise 3: Miles to Kilometers Calculator

    <div class="card-body">
        <p>In this exercise, you will create another Python application to convert miles to
            kilometers.
            This
            conversion is just the opposite of what you did in the last exercise! Your application
            must
            allow
            the user to enter the number of miles and then convert and display kilometers.</p>
        <div id="miles-per-km" class="ic-flash-info">
            <p>1 kilometer = 0.62 miles.</p>
            <p>This is the conversion factor that you are given. It must be in your code. Do not
                lookup
                another,
                or calculate the inverse. Any other values will produce (slightly) different
                results.
                Use
                the
                supplied value.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Python Source Code</h3>
        <p>You will create a new source code (.py) file in the Python IDLE the same way you did in
            exercise
            1.
            The file name is left to your discretion but choose a reasonably concise, yet
            <em>descriptive</em>
            name for your project such as MilesToKm. Make sure you save the file in your Lab01
            folder.
        </p>
        <p>Like exercise 1, be sure to code the shebang line and comments with your name, course No.
            and
            lab
            exercise.</p>
        <div id="enter-miles" class="ic-flash-info">
            <p><strong>Hint:</strong> For your input, you will need a line of code something like
                this:
            </p>
            <pre>miles = float(input("Enter miles: "))</pre>
        </div>
        <p>You will create the Python file the same way you did in exercise 1.</p>
