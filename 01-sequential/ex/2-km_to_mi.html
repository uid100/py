        Exercise 2: Kilometers to Miles Calculator
    </div> .card-header -->
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>In this exercise, you will create another Python application to convert kilometers to
            miles. Your application must allow the user to enter the number of kilometers and then
            convert and
            display miles.</p>
        <div id="constant" class="ic-flash-info">
            <p>1 kilometer = 0.62 miles.</p>
            <p>This is the conversion factor that you are given. It must be in your code. Do not
                lookup or calculate another.</p>
        </div> <!-- #constant -->
        <p>Before writing any code, consider writing some logical pseudocode as it will help you
            break down the problem into understandable pieces.</p>
        <p>
            What are meaningful and descriptive names for your variables?
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Hint:</strong> in this case, "number1" and "number2" and "product" are not
            meaningful or descriptive for this project.
        </p>
        <p>You will create a new Python source file (.py) in the Python IDLE the same way you did in
            exercise 1.
            The file name is left to your discretion but choose a reasonably concise, yet
            <em>descriptive</em>
            name for your project such as KmToMiles. Make sure you save the file in your Lab01
            folder.
        </p>
        <p>Like exercise 1, be sure to code the shebang line and comments with your name, course No.
            and lab exercise.</p>
        <div id="enter-km" class="ic-flash-info">
            <p><strong>Hint:</strong> For your input, you will need a line of code something like
                this:
            </p>
            <pre>km = float(input("Enter kilometers: "))</pre>
