            <h3>Lab Folder Structure</h3>
            <p><img style="display: block; border: 2px solid black;"
                    src="/course-content/images/lab_folders.png"

            <p>Before starting on any lab work for this class, take a few minutes to create a
                folder structure for your labs like the one shown below. Being organized is a
                critical survival skill in software development.</p>
            <p>If you are using the classroom lab computers, be sure to create this on a remote
                cloud storage, or removable USB storage device and be sure to save to it! Saving
                on the C: drive of the lab computers is a disaster waiting to happen!
            </p>
            <p>Notice that the folders are numbered "lab01", "lab02", and so on. If you number
                these using only a single digit, then when we labs 10, 11, and 12, the natural
                ordering of your folders will be lab1, lab10, lab11, lab12, lab2, lab3, ...
            </p>
            <p>Since there are more than 10, and less than 100, using 2 digit numbers makes sense.
