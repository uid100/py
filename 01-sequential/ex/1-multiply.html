        <h3>A Guided Python Application</h3>
        <div id="guided" class="ic-flash-info">
            <p>For most of the labs in this class, the first exercise will be a guided walk
                through where we will apply the chapter concepts to develop a working Python
                application.
            </p>
        </div> <!-- #guided -->
        <div id="ex1-intro">
            <p>In this exercise, you will be guided through the steps of analyzing a problem
                statement and creating a working Python application using Python IDLE
                (Integrated Development and Learning Environment). Be sure to complete this
                exercise as you will be repeating these steps and writing the same (or very
                similar) code for the other exercises.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Be aware, practice is the key here. The more you do,
                the easier it gets!

            <p>Step one is <strong><i>always</i></strong> to analyze the problem and figure out
                a plan of attack. Consider the following problem statement.

                    <del> It&rsquo;s a bright, sunny day and the College Learning Center has hired you
                        as a consultant to develop an application that will </del>
                    accept two input numbers from the user and display the product of the two
                    <del>values</del> numbers.

            </div>
            <p>Break it down into <strong>input, process and output</strong>.</p>
            <p>This is a simple problem and we can easily break it down into &ldquo;workable
                pieces&rdquo; using this approach.
            </p>
            <p><em>What input do we need?</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>We need 2 numbers.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>We can logically name these <code>number1</code> and <code>number2</code></p>
            <p><em>What is our process?</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>We need to multiply the 2
                    numbers.</strong><br />Our formula is:</p>
            <pre>product = number1 * number2</pre>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The result of multiplying two numbers is called the <code>product</code>.

            <h3>Logic <i>Pseudocode</i> &amp; Python Source Code</h3>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Start Python IDLE.</li>
                <li>From the File menu, click New File<br /><img
                        src="/course-content/images/lab01_fig1_menu_file_new.jpg"
                        alt="IDLE menu  File &gt; New " width="323" /></li>
                <li>Create a new file and save as
                    <pre>multiply.py</pre>
                    to your Lab 1 folder. Note that Python source files must have the .py
                    extension.<br />If
                    IDLE is saving as type <em>Python Files</em>, then the extension will be
                    assigned
                    for
                    you.
                    If you try and enter "multiply.py", you may end up with a file named
                    "multiply.py.py".
                    This
                    is why it is important to enable file extensions in the <em>Before you
                        begin</em>
                    tab.<br /><img src="/course-content/images/lab01_fig4_save_py.jpg"
                        alt="Save As Python (.py) file" />
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>Write the code shown in the Python code screenshot below. Pay close
                        attention to
                        letter
                        case. Note the following things we will be doing for virtually every lab
                        exercise:
                        <li>Be sure to code the shebang line #!/user/bin/env python3. This
                            identifies
                            the
                            file
                            as an executable Python script file.</li>
                        <li>In comments at the top, put in your name, course number and the lab
                            exercise
                            information. See sample below.</li>
                        <li>Use the input() method for getting user input.</li>
                        <li>Use the print() method for displaying output.</li>
                        <li>Use the int() method to convert text to an integer.</li>
                        <li>Use the float() method to convert text to a float.</li>
                        <li>Use the str() method to convert an integer value to string.</li>
                        <li>The program code should follow the pseudocode!</li>
                        <li>In Python, anything after a single hash (#) character is a comment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Here&rsquo;s a sample comment header at the top with your name, the course
                        number,
                        and a
                        brief description of the lab exercise.</p>

                    <ul>In the code below, a couple more things to note:
                        <li>We declare variables using a concise, yet descriptive name.</li>
                        <li>Python determines the data type by the initial value.</li>
                        <li>We use a single equal sign (=) for assigning literal values (i.e., 0,
                            etc.)
                            or
                            the
                            result of an expression to a variable.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><em>Wow! That's a lot!</em></p>
                </li>
                <li>Be sure to save your work!</li>
                <li>Run your application. Select Run Module from the Run menu.<br /><img
                        src="/course-content/images/lab01_fig5.jpg"
                        alt="IDLE menu Run &gt; Run Module" /></li>
                <li>Choose test values so that you can easily verify that your program is producing
                    the
                    correct
                    output. For example:<br /><img src="/course-content/images/lab01_fig6.jpg"
                        alt="Run with sample test values" /></li>
                <li>Try (test) your program with different values to be sure it is working.</li>
                <li>If you get a correct output, congratulations! <br>

                    You have just successfully created your first Python application!</li>
