            <h3>Submission</h3>
            <p>When you have completed all three exercises, you will need to submit your work to Canvas.
            </p>
            <p>Here is the step-by-step <strong>submission</strong> process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Zip your lab folder. The folder should contain the following files:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>multiply.py</li>
                    <li>KmToMiles.py</li>
                    <li>MilesToKm.py</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Submit the zipped file (Lab01.zip) to Canvas.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <h3>Outline</h3>
                <p>Before submitting your assignment, step through this checklist to be certain that
                    everything
                    is
                    complete. You should also check the grading rubric to see if there is anything that
                    you
                    might
                    have forgotten.</p>
                <p>Here is the step-by-step <strong>outline</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create the Lab folder structure</li>
                    <li>Read (and understand) the pseudocode as described in the lab instructions</li>
                    <li>Create a new .py file and write the code for the sample exercise, run it and
                        view
                        the
                        result
                    </li>
                    <li>Create a new KmToMiles.py file and write the code for your solution (follow the
                        example
                        and
                        modify as needed from step 4). Run it and check your results.</li>
                    <li>Create a new MilesToKm.py file and write the new code, test, and confirm the
                        result.
                    </li>
                    <li>Zip your files and submit to Canvas <strong>(must be a zip file).</strong></li>
                </ol>
